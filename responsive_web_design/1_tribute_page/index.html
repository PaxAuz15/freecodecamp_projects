                    My father <strong>was very naughty</strong> from a young age. He has escaped from killer cows and from escaping death by drowning in a fast-flowing river. But always getting away with a big smile at the end of living crazy experiences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He has had the opportunity to listen to <strong>Julio Jaramillo</strong> live: on a recording set, among friends and a few good beers. He told me it was an unforgettable experience; he always knew he would become a music legend.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was also a person who enjoyed making neighborhood friends. Every evening they would get together with a radio, listen to music while sharing conversations and bitter jokes over a few beers.
